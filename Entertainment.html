                <p id="entertainmenttoptext">Entertainment: Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the
                    rainforest, and to visit the
                    volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on
                    chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including
                    a
                    microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an
                    arcade,
                    visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next
                    year.
                    Many
                    of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north
                    side of
                    Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>

                <p>Sightseeing: Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture
                    and
                    nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or
                    bus
                    tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.</p>

                <p>Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
                    Private
                    buses
                    serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from
                    a
                    local
                    rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors
                    (helmets
                    are
                    required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
                    surrounding
                    Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</p>
