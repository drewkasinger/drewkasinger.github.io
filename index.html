        <h2>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
            miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
            tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
            indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was
            dominated by fishing or agriculture.</h2>
